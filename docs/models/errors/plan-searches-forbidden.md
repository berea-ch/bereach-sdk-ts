# PlanSearchesForbidden

The caller is authenticated but not allowed. Read code: subscription_required (API key or connector whose plan is not active), free_draft_limit (a free-plan limit was reached), sales_nav_seat_inactive (no active Sales Navigator seat), or forbidden (not permitted). The body is the flat `{ error: "<text>" }` form, with `code` when the answer carries one; a few answers use the envelope.
