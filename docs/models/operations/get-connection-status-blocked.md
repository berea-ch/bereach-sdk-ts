# GetConnectionStatusBlocked

Set only while something is stopping this account. Never set for the ordinary spacing between two invitations, which is not a fault: that is state 'spacing'. If this is null, nothing is wrong with the account.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { GetConnectionStatusBlocked } from "bereach/models/operations";

let value: GetConnectionStatusBlocked = {
  kind: "challenge",
  message: "<value>",
  resumesAt: "<value>",
  clearsItself: true,
  fixUrl: "https://striking-morning.biz/",
};
```
